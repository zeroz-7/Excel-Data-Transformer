script_generation_task:
  description: >
    You have been given a list of Excel file paths: {files}.
    Your primary goal is to generate a structured, modular Python script to transform the data in these files based on the user's instructions: {prompt}.
    First, use the 'Excel Data Inspector Tool' with the provided file paths to understand the data structure.
    Then, write the Python script. Ensure it includes step-by-step comments, error handling, and validation checks.
  expected_output: >
    A complete, executable Python script — no explanations, no markdown, just valid Python code.
validation_task:
  description: >
    Review the Python script generated in the previous step against the user's original instructions ({prompt}).
    Ensure that all requested transformations are correctly implemented and that the script is robust.
    If the script is perfect, output it directly.
    If there are issues, correct the script and provide the complete, final version.
  expected_output: >
    The final, validated, and complete Python script — no explanations, no markdown, just valid Python code.
